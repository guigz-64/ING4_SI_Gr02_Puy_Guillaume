Material Design is a design system created by Google to help teams build high-quality digital experiences for Android, iOS, Flutter, and the web.

Material-UI is the most popular React UI framework based on the Material Design recommandations.

## What is Material Design

* Inspired by the physical world and its textures, including how they reflect light and cast shadows.
* Announced in 2014 by Google.

* Use motion to focus attention and maintain continuity through subtle feedback and coherent transitions.

## Material components

* Interactive building blocks for creating a user interface.

  * Display: Placing and organizing content using components like cards, lists, and sheets.
